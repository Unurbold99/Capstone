# Capstone
 X-Ray Deep-Learning
Conclusion and Evaluation:

   The whole project was very challenging in the way that we had to give directions to ourselves and be responsible for whole of the project from gathering a explorable and trainable data to EDA, cleaning and training. One of the things I would specifically change for my project if I could is that I would make it much simpler by having only 2 classes(No Finding, Finding) and make the model just way better, push the training to have almost 0 false negatives, so a person uploading a picture can have no worries of fale negative if it shows No Findings. This would have made my project way simpler and usable to an extent. Another change would be to do more research on how the image classification actually works to maybe transform my pictures better to get better results, it is very hard to just trial and error it, especially when the training time is very long. Overall the Project was very practical, as always the data is the most important part of any data science task, on top of that I learner that error handling should also be seen as a skillset and is very valuable, being able to understand the error at hand and research into it to fix it.
